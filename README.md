# Assignment_Refactor_Code
## TODOS
I will address some of the issues here that can be further done 
* when using componenets we need to make sure each have a seperate folder, inside that css, js or other helpers of the components should be added.
* we can add a stat management library like redux.
* move the apis logic into seperate files, i.e each service will have one file. also preferably we can use axios with it.
* I myself would prefer to work with functional components, it makes the code more readable and understandable.
* I have added some test cases, but there should be a constant ratio of test cases i.e (unit test : integration test : end to end)
* folder structure should be improved, images should be inside assets along with other data.
* first of all, keep the code as simple as possible no need to complicate things.
* avoid too much inline styling, use styled components
